## 2. Pitch Deck Story

### Slide 1: The Problem
**Header:** Watching Together is Broken.
**Body:** 
- We live in a multi-screen world.
- Trying to play the same song or video across a phone, laptop, and iPad results in chaos.
- Different latencies. Echoes. No true synchronization.

### Slide 2: The Insight
**Header:** Time is the Enemy.
**Body:**
- Bluetooth speakers have range limits and pairing nightmares.
- Cloud streaming has variable buffers.
- Devices don't share a common "now".

### Slide 3: The Solution
**Header:** Zync.
**Body:**
- Zync creates a single shared moment across every device on your local network.
- 0.0s perception latency.
- No cloud delay. No expensive hardware.
- Just your browser and your Wi-Fi.

### Slide 4: Why It's Different
**Header:** Sub-frame Precision.
**Body:**
- **Local Wi-Fi Sync:** We bypass the internet and sync directly on the LAN.
- **Adaptive Clock:** Our algorithm calculates network jitter and offsets audio playback to the millisecond.
- **Scalable:** Works with 2 phones or 200 laptops.

### Slide 5: The Vision
**Header:** Collaborative Screens.
**Body:**
- A world where screens don't compete—they collaborate.
- Turn a room of phones into a surround sound system.
- Sync a silent disco.
- One moment. Every screen.
